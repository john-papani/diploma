# ANTLR4 Grammar

This directory contains the ANTLR4 grammar file and related files for parsing the Greek Parliament debate text files and generating XML output based on the Akoma Ntoso standard.

## File Description

- `DebateGrammarLexer.g4`: This file contains the lexer grammar specification for the debate text files. The lexer breaks the input text into tokens according to the specified rules.

- `DebateGrammarParser.g4`: This file contains the parser grammar specification for the debate text files. The parser uses the tokens generated by the lexer to build a parse tree based on the specified grammar rules.

## Usage

_To use the ANTLR4 grammar for parsing the debate text files:_

Generate the lexer and parser classes using the ANTLR4 tool. Use the following command:

    antlr4 -encoding utf8 -Dlanguage=Python3 DebateGrammarLexer.g4 DebateGrammarParser.g4

This command will generate the necessary lexer and parser files in the current directory.

- _If necessary, in the future:_<br>
  Update the grammar files as per the debate text file structure. Modify the `DebateGrammarLexer.g4` and `DebateGrammarParser.g4` files to match the tokenization and parsing rules specific to your text files.

- Ensure you have ANTLR4 installed. If not, you can install it by following the instructions on the ANTLR website: [https://www.antlr.org/](https://www.antlr.org/)
