# LDA - Topic Modelling 

This directory contains code related to Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) - Topic modelling.

## Folder Structure

- `lda.py` : This Python script contains the implementation of the LDA - topic modelling algorithm.

- `results/`: This directory is meant to store the results of the topic modelling process. You can find the output files and reports related to the LDA topic modelling here _(html format)_.

- `stopwords/`: This directory contains a list of common stopwords that are usually excluded during the text analysis process. 

- `wordcloud_img/`: Here, you can find the images generated from the word clouds representing the most frequent words in the topic modelling results. Word clouds provide a visual representation of the most common words in the analyzed text data.

- `top_terms_sorted_10.txt` and `top_terms_sorted_30.txt` : These text files contain the top terms or keywords associated with the topics generated by the LDA algorithm. The number indicates the number of top terms listed for each year.

### Run the LDA Algorithm:

```
python lda.py
``` 

>This will execute the LDA topic modelling algorithm on your text data and generate the results.
